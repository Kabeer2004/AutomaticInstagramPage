# AutoMedia: a basic Social Media Automator written in Python

A Python Script that can run an Instagram page on any topic for you automatically by reposting Reddit stuff.

To use this script, download it and update the required fields. You will need to add a reddit API key and the subreddit from where you want your posts to be sourced. 
You can also modify the list of hashtags and add a list of tags relevant to your posts. you can also set how much delay you want between each post. this can allow you to modify the frequency of posts.
this script works only for images 

you could also completely discard the reddit logic and have the tool post your own stuff at specific times. 

the last time this script was updated was 2021. instagram is weird about letting automated services create posts on their service so a few years/months or even weeks from the creation of this script, its entirely possible that it no longer works anymore

but feel free to take this script and update it with whatever python library allows posting to instagram whenever you use it. most of the other stuff like the image resizing logic and the decription/hashtag logic should be the same.

new project ideas based off of the same idea:
- an interesting project could be to take this and make it work for videos ðŸ‘€. an automated reels page could be legendary.
- another way of modifying this could be to make use of the new wave of AI tools and create completely AI generated posts on various topics and have them be posted daily.
